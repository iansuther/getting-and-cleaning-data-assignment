This CODE BOOK describes 
1. The Function "run_analysis.R" (produces for course assignment Getting and Cleaning Data)
2. The output data files of the execution of run_analysis


1. RUN_ANALYSIS
This function accepts the directory names of the train and test data sets, the data is then merged and tidied to give the final output.

The path to the files to where they were already downloaded is set in the global environement first, which is 
"./data science/getting and cleaning data/course project/UCI HAR Dataset"
and set the directory for the train and test data

The data for the features and activities of the data are read in
  
Combine the data sets in the following way:
  # 1. the activity data plus its labels (.._train and features)
  # 2. then the subjects of that data (... add the subjects)
  # 3. then label the data (...)
  
The training data is done first then the test data then they are merged
  
  # TRAINING DATA
      # read in the data
      # label the data
      # read in the activities and label the column
      # read in the subjects performing the activities and label the column
      # combine the data as columns

  # TEST DATA (repeat as for training data)
    
Now combine the train and test data

Then subset the data to give only those columns with mean or std in the name of the column

Activities columns are modified to use a descriptive name
  
An independent data set is created with average of activties by subject

Data is then written to a file ("train_test_data_avg.txt")
