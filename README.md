==================================================================

This assignment result creates one R script that does the following. 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.



The following files are included:

=========================================



- 'README.md': this file



- 'run_analysis.R': function that reads and merges the data sets provided. Then outputs a summarzed tidy data set



- 'getting and cleaning data codebook.txt': describes how the results were achieved



- 'train_test_data_avg.txt': summarized output from the execution of function run_anlysis
